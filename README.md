Sources to perform cheminformatics tasks within the Hadoop framework. It is currently
written using the JChem library, which you will need to provide. The Hadoop code is based
on Apache Hadoop 1.0.3

Compiling
---------

You will need to modify the `build.xml` to point to you version of the JChem jar file. After that
you can generate jar files for specific tasks

* SMARTS matching - `ant smarts-search`
* Bioisostere generation - `ant bioisostere`

Running
--------

Assuming you have your Hadoop cluster and associated HDFS set up, you can run the applications as
	 hadoop jar /path/to/jarfile args

For the bioisostere application you must specify the input file of scaffolds and scaffold members,
the output directory and the path to a license file. The input and license files should have been
copied into the HDFS. The application is then run as
    hadoop jar /path/to/bisos.jar input_file output_dir license.cxl
The format for the scaffold input file is 
    scaff_smi member_smi member_smi ....
